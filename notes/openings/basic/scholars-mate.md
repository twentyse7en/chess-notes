# 4-Step Chess Mate (Scholar's Mate)

The 4-step chess mate, also known as Scholar's Mate, is a quick checkmate pattern that targets the weak f7 square.

## Move Sequence (Single Line Format)
```movement
1. e4 e5 2. Qh5 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Qxf7#
```

## Explanation

- e4 opens lines for the queen and bishop.
- Qh5 and Bc4 both aim at the weak f7 square.
- Qxf7# is checkmate because the bishop on c4 protects the queen.

## Common Defense
```movement
1. e4 e5 2. Qh5 Nc6 3. Bc4 g6
```

This blocks the attack and forces the queen to move.
