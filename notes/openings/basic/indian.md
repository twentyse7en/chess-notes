# Indian Defense (Black)

The Indian Defense is a family of openings played by Black against 1. d4, characterized by controlling the center with pieces rather than immediate pawn occupation.

## Move Sequence (Single Line Format)
```movement
1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7
```

## Explanation

- **Nf6** develops a knight and prevents e4.
- **g6** prepares to fianchetto the bishop.
- **Bg7** places the bishop on the long diagonal, targeting the center.
- Black allows White to build a pawn center and plans to challenge it later.

## Main Line Example (King's Indian Defense)
```movement
1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 e5
```

- **d6** supports a later ...e5.
- **O-O** ensures king safety.
- **e5** strikes at White’s center.
- Positions often become dynamic and attacking.

## Key Ideas

- Control the center with pieces rather than pawns.
- Use kingside fianchetto pressure.
- Counterattack the center with ...e5 or ...c5.
- Play for dynamic middlegame chances.

## Common Alternative (Nimzo-Indian Setup)
```movement
1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4
```

Black pins the knight on c3 and pressures the center immediately.
